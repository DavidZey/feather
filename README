jojojs is a full-featured widget-based web framework implemented in pure js. 
The main goal is to enable rapid development of powerful RIA-type apps (long running single-page applications).

The proof of concept for jojojs was originally written for Aptana's Jaxer server (a js server based on Rhino/Spidermonkey: www.jaxer.org).
The only real bonus to Jaxer over node.js, however, is the presence of E4X (for widget templating) and a fully functional DOM on the server,
which is incredibly useful, but also amounts to quite a bit of overhead (a sandboxed DOM is recreated for every single request mapped to the
application space in Jaxer). 

So, I've decided to expand the scope of the framework a bit and standardize on node.js.

Since this is meant to be a full-featured framework, there will likely be some dependencies (like jQuery and CouchDB for example). 
This is not intended to be a bits-and-pieces library, but where possible I will try to keep things modular so they can be used standalone... just know,
however, that that is not a primary goal of the project. 

In the end, I want to develop apps from the browser, using jojojs/jojojs-client

ABOUT THE NAME:
I had originally created a skeleton framework called MojoJojo, which was to be a Canvas game engine for Palm's WebOS. Their 
built-in framework was called Mojo, and I liked how adding Jojo to it made three consecutive jo sounds (and I also
enjoyed that it shared names with the main villian from the Power Puff Girls). As I continued to then implement
my generic web framework in javascript, I hijacked my own name and took out the Mojo part. That's a true story. I did not
name it jojo because it looks close to dojo, and at the time I did not realize there was a CMS project called jojo.
So, I like the name jojojs and I'm sticking with it, so there :)
