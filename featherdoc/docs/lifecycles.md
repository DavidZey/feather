# Life-cycles

## Overview

The life-cycles of a feather application are any set of actions that begin with an action by either
an administrator or a user, and have a finite set of tasks to execute. A good example of a
life-cycle is an HTTP GET request from the client.

The existing life-cycles of a feather application are:

* Application Startup
* Application Shutdown
* User Request
* Socket Communication
